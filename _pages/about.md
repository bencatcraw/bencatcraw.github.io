I'm Benjamin Crawford, a game developer with a passion for player-focused design. I’ve spent most of my life exploring games from every genre not just as a player, but as a competitor. Having played in the competitive esports scene during my undergrad, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for balance, mechanics, and player experience, all of which strongly influence the way I design and build games.

I've worked on many **[projects](/projects/)** ranging from games to projected visualizations, and I've also took part in a few **[internships](/cv/)** as well. I'm always working on something new, so check the **[blog page](/blog/)** to see my most recent work!

I'm currently looking for an internship as a <u>game designer</u> or <u>gameplay programmer</u>, where I can contribute my skills, creativity, and enthusiasm to new projects.
