**Wheelchair Wizards** is is a 4 player party game where you battle your friends while upgrading your wizard. Wheelchair Wizards is available on Steam for free, and has seen over 50,000 unique players in 5 months and has 1000+ daily active users.

Wheelchair Wizards was created in Godot, to challenge my cross-engine knowledge. It uses a recompiled version of the engine to incoporate GodotSteam, a networking library for leveraging Steam's built-in P2P.
