**Cookie & Cream** is a coop VR cooking game where the players play as cats. While one player takes orders and fills drinks, the other frantically makes food while the timer counts down.

Cookie & Cream was one of my first attempts at true online multiplayer using Unity's P2P solutions: Netcode for Gameobjects and Relay. The source code is available **[here](https://github.com/bencatcraw/VRCATCAFE)**.
