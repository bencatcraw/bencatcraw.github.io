**Cloud Runner** is a fast paced interactive parkour game that has the player running on clouds while slicing buildings and parrying meteors to fight back against an evil megacorporation.

Cloud Runner was an experimental project, where I spent a lot of time focused on parts of game design I felt I didn't have lots of experience in. Most notably: level design, cutscenes, and shaders.
